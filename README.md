# Shutterbug

A social media app made with SvelteKit. It is my first SvelteKit project, and I certainly learned a lot while making it!

The concept: Every week, a new one-word theme is released. You and your friends have that week to upload a photo inspired by that theme. Then, after the week is over you vote on your friends' submissions by setting sliders in 3 categories: Humour, Creativity, and Photography.

It is currently still being worked on and tested, but the basic concept has been implemented.
